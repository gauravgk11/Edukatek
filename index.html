        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">A good quality education is one that provides all learners with capabilities they require to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods, contribute to peaceful and democratic societies and enhance individual well-being. The learning outcomes that are required vary according to context but at the end of the basic education cycle must include threshold levels of literacy and numeracy, basic scientific knowledge and life skills including awareness and prevention of disease. Capacity development to improve the quality of teachers and other education stakeholders is crucial throughout this process. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Indian Education system is often scrutinized by all the stakeholders. Students complain that the system tests their memory and not their intelligence; parents complain about the system promoting nothing but a rat race; teachers complaining about students not catching up with the syllabus. But if we all stop for a moment and look back into why we are learning the way we are and how we have adapted to the global trend, the white noise vanishes.We were and are considered to be the beacon of light, the centre of learning since ancient times. As said before, to eliminate the white noise we should understand how we got here. Unlike the Occident, there was something very unique about the way education was taking place back here in India. </p>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Lets grow together</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The whole idea of education was focused on the enrichment of culture, character, and personality, development, and cultivation of noble ideals. The objective was to gain mental, physical, and intellectual toughness, to make the students future-ready and survive in any situation.Education was a platform of interactive academic co-existence amongst scholars of diverse specializations. This was to facilitate the convergence of disciplines and transactional mutuality of holistic wisdom. The Gurukulas were the epitome of experiential learning; they thrived in all aspects of our heritage, culture, arts, drama, music, and archaeology. Since there were no books back then, teaching was basically via orals and debates.</p>
